You may combine the data into a 3d array with a shape that is compatible with `plt.imshow()` (check the matplotlib documentation!) or you can experiment with the Astropy function [make_lupton_rgb](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.visualization.make_lupton_rgb.html#astropy.visualization.make_lupton_rgb). You can find a [tutorial in the Astropy documentation](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/visualization/lupton_rgb.html).\n",

    "   \n",
    "- Now, you will calculate a radial profile of the image data to estimate the size of the shell of the supernova remnant. First, define two radii (`radii_min` and `radii_max`) around the center position of *Cas A*. Choose a total minimum radius of `0 arcmin` and total maximum radius of `5 arcmin` and divide this range in 50 steps.  Sum up all the data that is contained in these rings. You can use [np.indices()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.indices.html) to get arrays of x and y pixel positions, that can be transformed into sky positions.  **Hint**: You can use a clever numpy masking and broadcasting to avoid a Python loop over the `radii_min` and `radii_max` arrays. [ndarray.reshape(-1, ...)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html#numpy.reshape) might be useful to expand the data and radius arrays to the third dimension). "

    "This catalog of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope's Large Area Telescope (LAT) sources reports the locations, spectra, and variability properties of 360 sources significantly detected in the 50 GeV – 2 TeV energy range during the first 80 months of the Fermi mission. The catalog includes 25 spatially extended objects.\n",

    "Blazars and blazars candidate accounts for 75% of the catalog indicating that this source class largely dominates the highest-energy LAT sky. SuperNova Remnants (SNRs) and Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe) together make up the second largest source class with 10% of the catalog total. The catalog comprises 57 sources not previously included in the 3FGL Catalog, 130 sources not included in the 1FHL Catalog, and 282 sources not detected by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes. There are 48 2FHL sources that could not be associated with known gamma-ray emitting objects.\n",

There are a few possible ways to identify the groups of source class. One of them is to use [Table.group_by()](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.table.Table.html#astropy.table.Table.group_by) followed by a loop over the groups (check Astropy documentation!) another way is to use a regular Python `set` to idenfity the unique entries in the `'CLASS'` column and loop over those. You can use `plt.subplot(projection='aitoff')` to instanciate a matplotlib axes with `'Aitoff'` projection. Note that the `'Aitoff'` projection requires angular positions measured in radians."
